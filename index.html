			<p>I am a scientist at <a href="https://www.ornatx.com/" target="_blank">Orna Therapeutics</a>, investigating LNP-oRNA's physical and chemical properties using liquid chromatography-based techniques. Prior to joining Orna, I received my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Chad Mirkin</a>. My research focus was on designing tumor-targeting nanoparticles with high internalization rate into cancer cells, and with improved bioavailability and tumor accumulation. To this end, I incorporated active targeting and stealth effects into nanoparticles by coating tailored proteins onto their surfaces, and designed nanoparticles with a tumor-associated enzyme-cleavable surface protection layer. I also investigated the biological behaviors of liposomes whose surface is co-grafted with nucleic acids and hydrophilic polymers.</p>

			<p>At Northwestern, I was also involved with the <a href="https://adca.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Advanced Degree Consulting Alliance</a>, serving as the Co-President from 2019 to 2020.

			<p>Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from <a href="https://umich.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor</a>, where I did research in <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~koplab/index.html" target="_blank">Raoul Kopelman's research group.</a></p>
